## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
1+2
```
I saw that 1+2=3
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
experiment <- read.csv(file = "data/experiment.csv")
```


```{r}
experiment2 <- experiment2
experiment2$protein_names <- paste("Protein Name:", experiment2$protein_names)
```
``` {r}
experiment$protein_names
experiment$intensity + 1
paste("Protein name:", experiment$protein_names)
```
```{r}
experiment$intensity +experiment$intensity
experiment$protein_names + experiment$intensity
```

```{r}
c(1, 2, "f")
```

```{r}
list(3.14, TRUE, "banana")
list_example <- list(title = "Numbers", numbers=c(1, 2, 3), data_exist=TRUE)
```

```{r}
fruits <- c("apple", "apple", "banana", "grape", "grape")
factor_fruits <- factor(fruits)
```

```{r}
mydata <- c("case", "control", "case", "control")
factor_mydata <- factor(mydata, levels = c("control", "case"))
```

```{r}
replicate <- c(1, 2, 1)
experiment <- cbind(experiment, replicate)
```

```{r}
levels(experiment$protein_names) <- c(levels(experiment$protein_names), "FOXO3")
new_protein <- list(protein_names="FOXO3",
                   intensity=1.5,
                   in_membrane=0,
                   replicate=2
                   )
experiment <- rbind(experiment, new_protein)
```
```{r}
experiment[,-4]
```
